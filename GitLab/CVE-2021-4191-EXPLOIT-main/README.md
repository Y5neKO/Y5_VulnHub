# CVE-2021-4191 - GitLab User Enumeration

GitLab is a widely-used web-based DevOps lifecycle tool that offers a Git-repository manager with integrated features for continuous integration, issue tracking, code reviews, and more. The GraphQL API is a powerful interface that enables users to interact with GitLab programmatically and perform various actions.

The GitLab CVE-2021-4191 vulnerability arises from an oversight in user enumeration within the GraphQL API for specific versions of GitLab. Instances of private GitLab deployments with restricted sign-ups may be susceptible to this issue.

User enumeration is a technique used by attackers to determine the existence of user accounts on a system by exploiting differences in the system's response to valid and invalid queries. In this case, unauthenticated users can leverage the GraphQL API to enumerate existing user accounts on vulnerable GitLab instances.

By crafting specific queries and analyzing the responses, malicious actors can deduce whether a particular username is registered on the GitLab instance, potentially aiding in further targeted attacks.

# Impact

The GitLab user enumeration vulnerability (CVE-2021-4191) may allow attackers to obtain a list of valid usernames registered on a private GitLab instance with restricted sign-ups. Armed with this information, attackers could launch targeted attacks, such as phishing campaigns or other exploitation attempts against the identified users.
